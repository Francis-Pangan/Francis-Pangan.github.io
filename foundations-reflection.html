      <ul>
        <p><strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong></p>
        <ol>
        <li>I can't learn everything in one go - I have to be patient with myself and realise that learning is not necessarily a linear progression, and it doesn't all go smoothly!<br /><br /></li>
        <li>I used to think that pushing myself to do more was a good thing, but I always ended up tired and unfocused.&nbsp;<br />Now I realise that taking&nbsp;breaks is healthy, and it allow me to do my job better.&nbsp;<br /><br /></li>
        <li>Anyone can learn anything, at any age! And the more I do one thing, the better I'll be at it.&nbsp;</li>
        </ol>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong></p>
        <p>Values allow us to look at ourselves and determine what principles we live by, and what's important to us. I believe that wie as humans stamp a little bit our ourselves in most things we create. When we're coding, we're passing on a bit of our own identity and values to our code and we need to be aware of what those values are.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;In an industry like web development, we'll all be collaborating with other people - we can't get by&nbsp;on our own. So it's important to be aware of what others are feeling, and get along with them.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>I think that without self-awareness we wouldn't really learn from our mistakes and just keep repeating them. Being self-aware also allows us to be mindful of how we're feeling, and manage our stress or other negative emotions, instead of just letting it run and control us.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong></p>
        <p>&nbsp;I suppose it's that most companies don't really teach core skills to their employees. I have seen people work themselves until they are burnt out, and have to take sick leave or resign from their jobs because they push themselves too hard. Or people who were let go from work because they lacked the ability to empathise with others.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong></p>
        <p>I&nbsp;think that when I enrolled at Dev Academy, I had the idea that I would be a programmer, and it would be pretty straightforward. Turns out, it's not that straightforward.</p>
        <p>Coming up with a learning plan was definitely challenging, but after that I felt like I had a bit of a safety net to fall back on when the going gets tough.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong></p>
        <p>I think it is important to have tools to cope or methods to take care of our own mental health during difficult times. It's also important to be aware of others around you and get along with them! Learning to code is difficult on its own, and I'll need all the help I can get. I'm sure that when I'm working as a web developer in the future, the core skills will also be very useful.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong></p>
        <p>There were some times when I thought more time should have been spent learning tech than core, because I struggled with programming sometimes. <br />But it was good to take a break from learning code and study core.&nbsp;There were some parts of it that was helpful (Neuroplasticy especially) for me to turn to when I was getting a bit stuck with tech learning.</p>
