        <p>Hello, dear imaginary, non-technical friend. Time for our weekly catch up!</p>
        <p>Today we'll be looking at <strong>Problem solving!</strong></p>

        <h3>Tell a story about how you got blocked on a simple problem, and how you solved the problem in an elegant way.</h3>
        <p>
       I was trying to complete the FizzBuzz challenge and was struggling with how to write the IF ELSE statements. It was hard to get my head around the decision tree at first. 
        </p>
        <p>
       Then I thought about how similar IF ELSE decision trees are to a flow chart, and that was the solution! I wrote down how I would like my code to flow, and looked up what symbols to use with my code, and was able to map out how the IF, ELSE IF, ELSE statements would work. I wrote pseudocode and used <em>console.log</em> quite a bit to tweak my code, but it in end I got everything tickety-boo.
        </p>
        <p>
          I felt pretty good about the process, and learned that tackling big problems are easier once you step back and break down the problem. I think I would want to develop more problem solving techniques as I go to minimize stress and frustration with code.
        </p>



        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        
        <h3>How confident do you feel using problem solving techniques and process?</h3>
        <p>
        I feel fairly confident in most areas - I do a lot of pseudocode, and when I feel like I'm on to something but don't want to lose my work, I always duplicate my code, and comment out the duplicate so I have a little backup.
        </p>

        <p>
        I'm still getting the hang of reading error messages - I know it points to the lines in my code, but sometimes the error messages are still a bit unclear to me. Using console.log and console.log (typeof) helps me narrow down where the issue is.
        </p>

        <p>
          Google is sometimes helpful, sometimes not. Some of the resources that I find rely on jargon or other knowledge I don't have yet. I have a few videos saved and I try to focus on learning the fundamentals and understand what it is I'm doing as I go.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm still a bit shy when it comes to asking for help, something I need to work on. I guess my attitude has always been independent, "Don't worry, I'll figure it out" kind of mentality. It's a bit difficult to change, but I'm sure when we hit bootcamp, I'll be more open to asking people in person for help when I need it.
        </p>


        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          Javascript is hard! I think I'd feel better if there was more time to learn it, but at the moment I'm pulling out all my problem solving skills and still I hit road blocks. I have to admit, I have a certain impatience and frustration when I don't understand something, but I'm confident this will all click and make sense later on. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now when I do something right, I reflect on it and write it down (just my thing to reinforce my reflection). Again I have to remember to be patient with myself, that this is a bootcamp and everything is being taught in a very condensed way, but everthing is difficult before it gets easy. I just have to put in a few hours of coding per day, make it a habit, and trust that everything will fall into place. ðŸ¤˜
