      <p><h3>About Neuroplasticity</h3></p>
      <p>We’ve all been told that babies’ minds are like sponges and that they learn at a fast pace, but as we grow older, we gradually lose the capacity to learn new things. Neuroplasticity is now showing us that we can still re-wire our brain to do new things, and that our brain is “plastic’, or malleable. We all know that to get good at something, you have to practice at it. Turns out that it’s the same with brains - keep doing something, and your brain will literally re-shape itself and create new connections as you learn and repeat a new skill.</p>
      <p>Knowing this, we can now say that “it’s never too late to learn something”, and know that it’s true! I turn to this whenever I struggle with coding and know that things are difficult before they are easy, but even the best minds in the world started off where I am now - they just never stopped. So I just have to persevere, and keep practicing.</p>
      <p>Activities to help increase neuroplasticity: Travelling and experiencing new things, meditation, learning a new language (coding is like learning a new language, does that count?)</p>

      <p><h3>Growth Mindset</h3></p>
      <p>In simple terms, Growth mindset is about changing our internal thoughts from “I can’t” to “how can I?”, when we encounter problems or challenges. It’s about finding other ways to accomplish something rather than giving up. And it’s about realising that we’re all capable of growing, and your perceived level of your own intelligence, skills, or talents can always be improved on.</p>  
      <p>I think that most schools today do not encourage a growth mindset, and that’s what was surprising to me. Looking back, I can remember we’re always forced to memorise things and not really learn, and it was quite boring, I was never engaged, and the stuff we memorised were of no use in everyday life, and so I was always used to school being a chore.</p>
      <p>Since everybody has capacity for growth, I just need to remember that I’m still learning and my brain is getting used to new patterns of thought. It’s always hard to start and maintain a habit, but I think this is what I’ll need to build to continually improve.</p>

      <p><h3>How do these understandings shape or influence my learning plan?</h3></p>
      <p>I’ve always found I engage more by doing things and experimenting. But I also get frustrated easily when I’ve been stuck doing one thing for hours and nothing I do is making any difference. I just need to continue that habit and persevere a bit more, or try to break my work into chunks of time (like the pomodoro method). </p>
      <p>I also need to be a bit more patient with myself and not shy away from mental challenges. I could be a bit more systematic with my questions, like having three lists of things when facing a problem: “what worked”, “what didn’t work”, and “what else can I try”.</p>
