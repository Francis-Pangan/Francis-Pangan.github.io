      <p>Hi, I'm Francis. I live in Wellington, New Zealand.
       I moved here with my family from the Philippines in 2009.
       By day, I work as a membership advisor / admin for Engineering New Zealand, a non-profit organisation helping to engineer a better New Zealand.
       By night I <s>fight crime as the vigilante <strong>el Franko</strong></s> study web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've decided to study web development because I feel like I needed to grow and try new things. I like logic and puzzle solving, and I'm quite solution focused.
        Whenever someone gives me rules, I try to see how much I can push the boundaries, and to always ask questions. A manager suggested I give web dev a go, and after reading about what front-end developers do, it seemed a natural fit.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find that Web development is like learning a new language. It's a bit difficult to wrap my head around the
        technical aspects, and to understand how code works. There's still so much to learn and it can be overwhelming at times! Still, I try to manage my studies and get it to an acceptable, whelming level.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I'm getting the hang of HTML and CSS. It's good that there are heaps of websites out there to help me, because it's bloody confusing sometimes. Took me hours the other day to figure out why something wasn't working, and turns out I was missing a freaking <strong>{</strong>. Like, I could not <em>even</em>.
        But when it clicks, it's <a href="https://imgflip.com/s/meme/Satisfied-Seal.jpg">oh so satisfying.</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still learning as I go so my website isn't that flash yet, but will be updating as I learn more skills. And I wanted this website to have a retro kind of feel.
        (Hey pass me some more CSS over here! I thought that was supposed to add style?!)
      </p>
      <p>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9MFFjWIZpE&ab_channel=MemeSharing">And now, we're on to Javascript.</a> Man, it's hard to get used to. 
      </p>
      <p>In my spare time, I like to read fiction adventure books, play video games, but my main hobby is collecting and painting miniatures. <a href="https://www.puttyandpaint.com/">Yes, it's a thing.</a>
        I like to go out and hit the op shops with my wife or just take a walk around Wellington <s>just kidding, who walks?! I jump on Uber scooters!</s> when the weather is nice.
