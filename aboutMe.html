      <p>Hi, I'm Francis. I live in Wellington, New Zealand.
       By day, I work as a membership advisor / admin for a non-profit organisation.
       By night I <s>fight crime as the vigilante el Franky</s> study web development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find that Web development is like learning a new language. It's a bit difficult to wrap my head around the
        technical aspects, and to understand how code works. So far, the biggest challenge has been to understand Git.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, my focus is on HTML and CSS. It's good that there are heaps of websites out there to help me, because it's bloody confusing sometimes.
        But when it clicks, it's oh so satisfying. I'm still learning as I go so my website isn't that flash yet, but will be updating as I learn more skills.
        (Hey pass me some more CSS over here! I thought that was supposed to add style?!)
      </p>
      <p>In my spare time, I like to read fiction adventure books, play video games, and my main hobby is collecting and painting miniatures.
        I like to go out and hit the op shops with my wife or just take a walk around Wellington <s>just kidding, I use Uber scooters</s> when the weather is nice.
