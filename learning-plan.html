    <h3><strong>Learning Plan - Bootcamp</strong></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong></p>
    <p class="paragraph">I'm hoping to start either a new role within the company I'm working for, to start. I'd like to see what improvements I can make for the company website, and really just build experience and confidence in coding. I could probably also use this as a side hustle, a way to earn extra income while still coding so I keep my knowledge intact.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">Eventually I would of course want to work full time as a web developer. I think this could really open a lot of opportunities for me, and I can even work remotely for other companies and not limit myself to companies within New Zealand.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="paragraph"><strong>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</strong></p>
    <p class="paragraph">I think it'll be more or less the same from sprint 2.&nbsp;I really dislike feeling underprepared about something - if I don't know everything there is to know about a subject, then I'd rather avoid it. I realise that with coding, that is virtually impossible, and I think I'm getting used to that. It'll help me get used to the&nbsp;<em>learning on time&nbsp;</em>way of thinking.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I'm also learning to think like a programmer, break down the task and formulate a plan, which is a useful skill that can be applied to anything.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><strong>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</strong></p>
    <p class="paragraph">I haven't coded in&nbsp;a group before, and that's probably one of the biggest challenges for me. I'm just not that confident in my capabilities yet (perhaps confidence is another challenge in itself.) The final one may&nbsp;be finding ways to maintain my focus for 9 weeks and not burn myself out.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="paragraph"><strong>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></p>
    <p class="paragraph"></p>
    <p class="paragraph">Teamwork in general is one of the skills I would like to work on. I'm a naturally private and reserved person and I think I do have a tendency to, not exactly avoid, but keep contact with other people to a minimum. I'd also like to develop leadership skills, and also improve on my own self-awareness.</p>
    <p class="paragraph">&nbsp;</p>

    <p class="paragraph"><strong>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</strong></p>
    <p class="paragraph"></p>
    <p>I would like there to be support when I need it - whether it's technical support, or if I just need someone to talk to if I'm feeling overwhelmed.&nbsp;<br />I also ask for a bit of patience while I'm learning, and open and honest communication.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><strong>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</strong></p>
    <p class="paragraph"></p>
    <p class="paragraph">I have to be transparent and honest with my tutors about my workload and be able to reach out when I need help. Knowing when you need help and asking for it is a strength.<br />I&nbsp;need to remind myself that this is a&nbsp;<strong>bootcamp</strong>, and I need to apply the same military-like discipline and do my best every day.&nbsp;I've learned some core skills here, and I have those tools to fall back on when things become difficult.</p>
    <p class="paragraph"><br />At the same time, I'll be patient with myself and be aware of times when I need to unplug or disengage when it becomes too much, and get back to it when I'm feeling less stressed.</p>

    <h3><strong>Learning Plan - Foundations</strong></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong></p>
    <p>My first goal is to master the basics of web development and see what opportunities there are at my current job to implement what I've learned. I want to gain some experience in an environment I'm more comfortable with, and later on transition into UX/UI design. I have studied design and would like to be able to apply that in a digital setting. But apart from that, I haven't looked that far into the future yet.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Limitations:</strong>&nbsp;I can get stuck in a problem and focus too much on it, and run out of time to do anything else. I tend not to take breaks until I've finished my chunk of work. It can sometimes cause me to get frustrated and feel burnt out too quickly. Sometimes I try to do multiple things at once, and spread my attention on too many things. I also get easily distracted.&nbsp;I need to allocate a certain amount of time, per problem, and focus on completing one thing at a time.</p>
    <p><strong>Strengths:</strong>&nbsp;I'm always curious and I want to learn; I just have to be patient and realise that these things take time. I try to remind myself that everyone's got a different skill level or a different way of learning and I just have to focus on my own learning. Builing a daily habit of coding is my goal, so I always learn something everyday.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></p>
    <p>Time management skills, ways to cope when you're stuck on a technical problem, and also help how to look up resources. Possibly skills on how to keep focuse on the task at hand. How to be comfortable with not knowing everything you need to know. And how to keep my sanity intact when information overload inevitably short-circuits my brain.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme:<br /></strong><strong>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</strong></p>
    <p>I will conduct myself in a professional manner, and be respectful to others. I'll try to be aware of when I'm feeling overwhelmed, and when is the best time to ask for help. I'll also do my best to understand that sometimes life commitments get in the way and not everything can be planned for.</p>
    <p><strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong></p>
    <p>Leave the task temporarily, or move on to something different. Breathe, take a walk, stretch, or meditate. Write down how I feel, and what I'm grateful for. Listen to music and take a break. And if I'm still stuck, ask for help.</p>
    <p><br /><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>I'll try other avenues such as Google, and I expect I will ask my cohort on Slack if I have minor issues, but for the big ones I would mention it to the facilitators as soon as possible. Naomi has been helping me with an issue - although currently it's unresolved, at least she knows where I'm at.</p>
