      <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, to start off as a front-end developer, gain some experience, and later on transition into UX/UI design. I have studied design and would like to be able to apply that in a digital setting. I haven't looked that far into the future yet.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can get stuck in a problem and focus too much on it, and run out of time to do anything else.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;Or sometimes I try to do multiple things at once.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I need to allocate a certain amount of time, per problem, and focus on completing one thing at a time.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time management skills, ways to cope when you&rsquo;re stuck on a technical problem, and also help how to look up resources.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</strong></li>
        </ul>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will conduct myself in a professional manner, and be respectful to others. I&rsquo;ll try to be aware of when I&rsquo;m feeling overwhelmed, and when is the best time to ask for help. I&rsquo;ll also do my best to understand that sometimes life commitments get in the way..</span></p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave the task temporarily, or move on to something different. Breathe, take a walk, stretch, or meditate. Write down how I feel, and what I&rsquo;m grateful for. Listen to music and take a break. And if I&rsquo;m still stuck, ask for help.</span></p>
      <p><br /><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I try other avenues such as Google, and I expect I will ask my cohort on Slack if I have minor issues, but for the big ones I would mention it to the facilitators as soon as possible. Naomi has been helping me with an issue - although currently it&rsquo;s unresolved, at least she knows where I&rsquo;m at.</span></p>
