      <p><strong>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
        My first goal is to master the basics of web development and see what opportunities there are at my current job to implement what I've learned.
        I want to gain some experience in an environment I'm more comfortable with, and later on transition into UX/UI design. 
        I have studied design and would like to be able to apply that in a digital setting. But apart from that, I haven't looked that far into the future yet.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Limitations:</strong> I can get stuck in a problem and focus too much on it, and run out of time to do anything else. I tend not to take breaks until I've finished my chunk of work. It can sometimes cause me to get frustrated and feel burnt out too quickly. Sometimes I try to do multiple things at once, and spread my attention on too many things. I also get easily distracted.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I need to allocate a certain amount of time, per problem, and focus on completing one thing at a time.</span></p>

      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">
        <strong>Strengths:</strong> I'm always curious and I want to learn; I just have to be patient and realise that these things take time. I try to remind myself that everyone's got a different skill level or a different way of learning and I just have to focus on my own learning. Builing a daily habit of coding is my goal, so I always learn something everyday.

     </span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time management skills, ways to cope when you're stuck on a technical problem, and also help how to look up resources. Possibly skills on how to keep focuse on the task at hand. How to be comfortable with not knowing everything you need to know. And how to keep my sanity intact when information overload inevitably short-circuits my brain.</span></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>

      <p><strong>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</strong></li>
        </ul>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will conduct myself in a professional manner, and be respectful to others. I'll try to be aware of when I'm feeling overwhelmed, and when is the best time to ask for help. I'll also do my best to understand that sometimes life commitments get in the way and not everything can be planned for.</span></p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave the task temporarily, or move on to something different. Breathe, take a walk, stretch, or meditate. Write down how I feel, and what I'm grateful for. Listen to music and take a break. And if I'm still stuck, ask for help.</span></p>
      <p><br /><strong>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I'll try other avenues such as Google, and I expect I will ask my cohort on Slack if I have minor issues, but for the big ones I would mention it to the facilitators as soon as possible. Naomi has been helping me with an issue - although currently it's unresolved, at least she knows where I'm at.</span></p>
