        <p>Hello, again imaginary, non-technical friend!</p>
        <p>Welcome to my second Tech blog. Today we'll be looking at <strong>Javascript and the DOM.</strong></p>

        <h3>Describe the differences between HTML and CSS (using an analogy)</h3>
        <p>
         Hmmm. One way to put it is that HTML is like a person. 
         HTML defines the structure of your website, and without it your website simply would not exist.
         (and like a person, HTML also has similar body parts, like head(ings), a body, and foot(ers). Close enough!)
        </p>
        <p>
         CSS on the other hand, is like clothes. They provide style and make your website nice to look at.
         A person can walk around naked, and still function, but nobody wants to look at naked people. Same thing with websites. 
         Just like clothes don't have a form without people to wear them, CSS can't exist without HTML.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        
        <h3>Control flow & loops (with examples!)</h3>
        <p>
         Your browser is like a person - it reads your code from top to bottom and executes them one line at a time. While this is pretty straightforward, you want to add certain conditions to your website.
         For example, if a person were to log in to your weebsite, you want them to see a "log out" button, and hide the "log in" button so as not to confuse them.

          Control Flows allow you to control your websites behavior based on the user's actions.
          It's like flow charts, where you create for conditions for Javascript to run certain parts of your code.
        </p>

        <p>
          Loops allow us to perform a task and repeat it without having to write code over and over. A good example of this would be the alarm clock feature on your phone.
          You don't program it every night to wake you up in the morning, you simply tell it to wake you up on certain days of the week, but not on others. With javascript, you can also set certain conditions for it to repeat instructions, and set conditions for when you want your code to stop looping back.

        </p>

        <h3>What is the DOM and how you might interact with it?</h3>
        <p>
          The DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's the blueprint of your entire website.
          It's not a programming language, but rather a representation of how the browser looks at your code.
          Anyone can "look under the hood" of a website by going into the developer tools. 
          </p>
          <p>
            It also lets you locate specific lines in your code and edit a website in real time. 
            (it doesn't save though so you will only edit a local version)


        </p>

        <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects..</h3>
        <p>
          Data in arrays can hold and store a list of multiple items in  one variable.
          It's useful when creating a collection with an order, where items in the Array can be accessed based on their position within the list.
          
        </p>
        <p>
          Data in Objects contain a "key", and the corresponding property value. It's sort of like Microsoft Excel, where you create tables and make reference to the data stored within those tables.
          The downside to Objects is that it's not good at getting the order of the data stored inside it.
        </p>


        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
        <p>
          Functions allow you to create a series of instructions,package it into a block of code, and excute the code when you "call" the function.</p>
        <p>
          This can be very useful because <a href="https://youtu.be/bFEoMO0pc7k?t=10">you don't need to rewrite lines of code again and again</a> to order your browser to do the same thing.
          You just tell it to refer to your Function, and repeat the set of instructions stored within.
