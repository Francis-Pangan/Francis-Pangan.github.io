        <p>Hello, again imaginary, non-technical friend!</p>
        <p>Welcome to my second Tech blog. Today we'll be looking at <strong>Javascript and the DOM.</strong></p>

        <h3>Describe the differences between HTML and CSS (using an analogy)</h3>
        <p>
         Hmmm. One way to put it is that HTML is like a person. 
         HTML defines the structure of your website, and without it your website simply would not exist.
         (and like a person, HTML also has similar body parts, like head(ings), a body, and foot(ers). Close enough!)
        </p>
        <p>
         CSS on the other hand, is like clothes. They provide style and make your website nice to look at.
         A person can walk around naked, and still function, but nobody wants to look at naked people. Same thing with websites. 
         Just like clothes don't have a form without people to wear them, CSS can't exist without HTML.

        <h3>Control flow & loops (with examples!)</h3>

          Who's Lorem Ispum? Is he/she famous?

        <h3>What is the DOM and how you might interact with it?</h3>
        <p>
          The DOM stands for Document Object Model. It's the blueprint of your entire website.
