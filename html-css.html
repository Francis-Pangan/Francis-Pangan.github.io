        <p><strong>Hello, my imaginary, non-technical friend! I haven't seen you in like foreverrrr! </strong>
        <p><strong>Welcome to "Technically", my Tech blog. The Dev academy peeps done told me to research ONE of the following topics:</strong></p>    

        <ol type="A">
            <li>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</li>
            <li>What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?</li>
            <li>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</li>

      <h2>A. The difference between Margin, Border, and Padding</h2><em> (It was the easiest topic!)</em></p>
      
      <div>
        <p>
          A webpage's basic structure is that it's made up of boxes. Boxes inside boxes, nestled within boxes, beside other boxes... it's boxes all the way down.
          You can specify the size of these boxes, and the content inside them, by using <strong>Margins, Borders.</strong> and <strong>Paddings.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          <h3>Borders</h3>
          Let's talk about Contents real quick before we jump into Borders.
          When you add anything to your webpage, be it text, a picture, or anything else, this is known as the Content.

          Now your content will have boundaries (remember the boxes?). 
          These boundaries are your Border. Simple.
          You can order your CSS to apply style to your border, and define the color, how thick you want it to be, whether you want it to be solid, dashed, or any other style, etc.
        </p>


        <p>
          <h3>Paddings</h3>
          Now that we've defined borders, let's look at Paddings.
          A padding is the space between your content and the border. This space is transparent. 
        </p>


        <p>
          <h3>Margins</h3>
          Finally, Margins. This is the space between your border and other margins.
          Same as Paddings, Margins are transparent. 
        </p>

        <p>I created a small image to depict how these three work together:</p>
