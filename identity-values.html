     <p><strong>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took. </strong></p>
     <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We live in Wellington Central. Some time ago my parents who live in Lower Hutt wanted me and my wife to move to a flat closer to them so we could be nearby in case of emergencies. The flat was pretty much guaranteed for us. We packed our non-furniture stuff and moved it to my parents&rsquo; flat to make it easier to move to the new flat.</span></p>
     <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We didn&rsquo;t get a chance to check out the new flat until a day before we moved in. When we got there, the place was cold, mouldy, and it wasn&rsquo;t clean. At this point we had organised for movers to move our furniture from Wellington city to Lower Hutt.&nbsp;</span></p>
     <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our gut feeling was, we were going to be miserable in the new flat and we&rsquo;d rather stay in the city. In the end, I ended up calling the movers and asked them to instead move our stuff from my parent&rsquo;s flat back to the city. My parents were disappointed but ultimately respected our decision to not live close to them. I explained the reasons behind my decisions: that staying in the city meant I was close to work, and that I didn&rsquo;t need to live close to them, I could still visit them every now and then.</span></p>
     <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The whole experience made me realize that I should listen to my own intuitions and stand up for what I wanted and not let others influence my decisions, no matter that they have the best intentions for me. At the end of the day, my life is my own and I have to face all consequences of my actions.</span></p>

      <p><strong>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</strong></p>
      <p>Being born into an Asian family comes with its own set of challenges sometimes, especially if your family moves into a first-world country.</p>
      <p>My parents have always been more traditional with our upbringing, and most conversations would begin with "This is how it's done..."</p>
      <p>I've always challenged that and while there has been a few times where it was difficult to cross that generational and cultural gaps, I think in the end, they respected the fact that I could make my own decisions for myself.</p>

      <h3>Strengths and Limitations</h3>
      <p><strong>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</strong></p>
      <p>Some time ago, I completed a <a href="Gallup signature themes.pdf"> Gallup Signature themes assessment</a>, and it listed my five dominant themes as: Deliberative, Analytical, Consistent, Relator and Responsible. In terms of learning to code, I think most of these traits can help me, but consistency would be the most important trait in the list. I just have to make sure that I consistently put in work and learn when I have the time.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I haven't studied for a while, and only now do I notice that I have a tendency to deep dive into topics and get sidetracked, or spend too much time on one thing and end up not having enough time for others. Time management is something I'll need to work on, but the pomodoro technique seems to help.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. </p>
        <p>Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</strong></p>
        <p>I worked as a call centre agent before, and one of the challenges is speaking to older people who are not very familiar with computers.
          I remember this one conversation I had with an old lady who was on the verge of giving up and said she would instead call an IT person the next day to come in and fix her internet connection problem.</p>
        <p>I said to her that I believed she could do it, and it wasn't as complicated as it looked like. I took my time with her and guided her through the steps and at the end of it, she said she felt like she achieved something new and thanked me for my patience.</p>
        <p>I will need that kind of attitude and patience, for myself, when I'm learning a whole new skill in a very short amount of time. It's daunting sometimes when I look at other people's work and compare it with my own. So I'll focus on being the best version of myself that I can be and take it slow, but make sure I'm improving on something daily.</p>
