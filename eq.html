    <p><strong>What is the difference between EQ and IQ?</strong></p>
    <p>IQ (Intelleligence Quotient) is a measurement of how smart a person is. EQ (Emotional Quotient, or Emotional Intelligence) is how a person manages their emotions, and how they empathise and get along with others.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p><strong>Describe why EQ is important and how it is relevant to you?</strong></p>
  <p>Emotional Intelligence is highly imporant - probably more so than "regular intelligence".</p>
  <p>It allows us to stop and examine our emotions and not be ruled by them. If more people were educated in emotional intelligence, more people would be self-aware of how they're feeling, and would be able to stop and think, instead of being a slave to anger, jealousy, and all other negative emotions.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>In May 2018 we had a baby daughter, Isla Willow, who we called "Mochi". She was diagnosed with paraplegic Cerebral Palsy, and eventually, the doctors found out that the CP was just a side effect of something else. She was in constant pain, and her brain was deteriorating, and the doctors coudn't figure out why. <a href="https://givealittle.co.nz/cause/islawillow">She became terminally ill and passed away in 2019, five days before her first birthday.</a></p>
  <p>In the following months after her death, it was very difficult for me and my wife to cope with her loss, and feeling all the anger and sadness and frustration was almost too much. It was made even more difficult because we were around my own family, who were grieving themselves. It became this sort of echoing chamber for all the negative emotions. Someone would be sad, which would make us sad, and the cycle kept repeating again and again.</p>
  <p>After a while, I got tired of being depressed, and whenever the topic of Mochi came up, I would start to ask if talking about her was helpful to grieve, or if it would only make us sad again. Now, instead of being sad and angry all the time, I try to manage it and allow myself to grieve during her birthday/death anniversary.</p>
  <p>I still feel sad when I think of her. There are definitely days where I'm just not in the mood to do anything. But for the most part, at least now I'm allowing a time and space for grief, rather than letting it rule my life completely. I want to move forward for my own mental health. Besides, not living in the present would not be honouring the memory of my baby.</p>
  <p>Being able to manage my grief (and also having a wife who was very supportive and also wanted to move forward) has allowed us to experience life again as it happens, and not constantly carry this burden with us.</p>
  <p>I want to manage my emotions, and be aware of myself whenever I have negative thoughts. I try to stop and think that everyone's got their story, and that everyone is doing the best with what life has given them. If they knew better, they would do better. Now and then I do fall back on my old habits, but I try my best to remind myself to be in the moment.</p>
